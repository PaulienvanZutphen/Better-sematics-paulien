## The assignment

Download this repo and run this project locally. The index.html uses several HTML tags that aren't that semantic (like span and div). Replace those tags with these more [semantic](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html5_semantic_elements.asp) tags:

- header
- main
- footer
- strong
- h1
- h2

Only replace HTML tags, do *not* edit the CSS code!

If you replaced the tags correctly the result should look like this:

## Submitting your work
* Create a new branch called **gh-pages** and upload your local work into this branch.
* Start a new **pull request**, select **one** reviewer and make sure to put the (working) **GitHub Pages URL** in the comment section. 
* Do **not** merge this Pull Request yourself. That's up to the reviewer to decide (merging is approving the assignment).
